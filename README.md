# Flatiron Phase 2 Project
 
In this notebook I'm  presenting my exploration of housing price data for sales made in King County, Washington between May 2, 2014 and May 24, 2015. I used used linear models in order to gain an understanding of how various features impact housing prices in the data set. Ultimately I created a model that explains about 83% of the price variance with a mean absolute error of under $65,000.
